Write a function to determine the minimum number of times the original sorted list was rotated to obtain the given list. Your function should have the worst-case complexity of `O(log N)`, where N is the length of the list. You can assume that all the numbers in the list are unique.\n",

    "\n",
    "Coming up with the correct solution is quite easy, and it's based on this insight: If a list of sorted numbers is rotated `k` times, then the smallest number in the list ends up at position `k` (counting from 0). Further, it is the only number in the list which is smaller than the number before it. Thus, we simply need to **check for each number in the list whether it is smaller than the number that comes before it** (if there is a number before it). Then, our answer i.e. the number of rotations is simply the position of this number is . If we cannot find such a number, then the list wasn't rotated at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In the list `[19, 25, 29, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 14]`, the number `3` is the only number smaller than its predecessor. It occurs at the position `4` (counting from `0`), hence the array was rotated `4` times.\n",

    "3. **Check whether the number at the current position is smaller than the one before it**\n",
    "4. **If it does, position is the answer, that is the number of rotations, and can be returned from the function**\n",
    "5. **If not, increment the value of position by 1, and repeat steps 3 to 6 till we reach the last position.**\n",
